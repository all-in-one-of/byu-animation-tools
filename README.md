byu-animation-tools
=============

This is a code base for BYU Animation scrips and tools.

**Place the byu-animation-tools folder inside the ${JOB} folder**

The tools are EXTREAMLY connected in an attempt to unify maya and houdini into a seamless pipeline.  As such, most all of the scripts and tools will rely on the project environment scrip.


TODO:

-create otl when maya model is added
-create file structure when otl is created, and add .obj to the geo folder

-modify to allow for 'stable' selection
