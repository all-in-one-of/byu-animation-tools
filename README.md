byu-animation-tools
=============

This is a code base for BYU Animation scripts and tools.

**Place the byu-animation-tools folder inside the ${JOB} folder**

The tools are EXTREMELY connected in an attempt to unify maya and houdini into a seamless pipeline.  As such, most all of the scripts and tools will rely on the project environment script.


TODO:

-Maya checkout
-Maya checkin
-create file structure when otl is created, and add .obj+.bjson to the geo folder

-modify to allow for 'stable' selection
