#BYU-Animation-Tools
=============

This is a code base for BYU Animation scripts and tools.

**Place the byu-animation-tools folder inside the ${JOB} folder**

The tools are EXTREMELY connected in an attempt to unify maya and houdini into a seamless pipeline.  As such, most all of the scripts and tools will rely on the project environment script.
